How to approach a industry standard structure toward a data science projects

# NOTE: THIS IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSE ONLY WHERE MANY OUTCOMES CAN COMES.

# Phase 1: Data Understanding 

A beginner-friendly Python script for performing the **Data Understanding** phase of a machine learning project, following the CRISP-DM methodology.

This script helps students learn how to explore a dataset thoroughly using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**. It covers:
- Dataset structure and info
- Summary statistics
- Missing values analysis
- Target variable distribution
- Unique values and cardinality
- Correlation analysis with heatmap
- Distributions and outlier detection for numerical features
- Value counts and bar plots for categorical features

# Perfect for learning #

## Dataset Used

This script works with any CSV dataset.  

You can download a sample dataset here:
- [Adult Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data)

Place your CSV file at `../data/raw/my_dataset.csv` relative to the script, or modify the `DATA_PATH` variable.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install dependencies:
